			<h1>Humanities</h1>
				<p>Humanities is a class taught by Ms. Small. In this class we essentially learn the history of the world through literature. This prompts us to read texts from various authors of different time periods and cultures. After we read the assigned texts for homework, we discuss it as a class in our sections the next day. Once all discussions are through, we are assigned an essay on broad topics, which allows for a lot of freedom. We get about a week for each essay, with an opportunity to rewrite it with corrections made.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="ContentFiles/GreekEssayFINAL.pdf">Ancient Greece</a></h2>
				<p>One of our units happened to be Ancient Greece. In this unit we discussed texts such as the Iliad by Homer, The Women of Troy by Euripides, and the modern Helen of Troy Does Countertop Dancing by Margaret Atwood. We discussed many topics in anticipation of our essay, and the general prompt was to connect the Greek worlds of the multiple time periods of these different authors mentioned above. To respond to this, I focused on the variations of Helenâ€™s portrayal. To read the rest of my essay, please click the heading above.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="ContentFiles/RevisedRayBradburyEssay.pdf">Ray Bradbury</a></h2>
				<p>Another one of our units was focused on works by the 20th century Sci-Fi author Ray Bradbury. We especially focused on two of his works, "August 2026" and "The Pedestrian." My essay focused on the differences between the two pieces. I attempted to prove that "August 2026" utilized narrative point-of-view, mood, and imagery more effectively to create the scene for a dystopian world.
