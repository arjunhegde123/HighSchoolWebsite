			<h1>Science and Technical Writing</h1>
				<p>This class is taught primarily by Ms. Curran, with the assistance of our visiting scholar Mr. Barnes. STW stands for Science Technical Writing. STW is very closely linked to our STEM I projects as it is important to document and explain in writing, our processes and findings. We are taught ways to improve our grammar, clarity, and idea flow through our scientific writing. We also learn how to read scientific papers, create figures and tables, and give presentations to further exemplify our projects.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="ContentFiles/StorkPaper.pdf">Stork Paper</a></h2>
				<p>One way we learn in STW is by analyzing other scientific works. One example of this was something we read early in the year, when we were still acclimating to the school. We read one particular paper known as the Stork Paper. This paper was quite ridiculous, but it was intended to be this was to show the differences in correlation versus causation. We were also asked to write a response to this paper, detailing our thoughts on it and how we perceived correlation and causation of the experiment and research. To view my response to the Stork Paper, please click the heading above.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="ContentFiles/Literature_Review_Hegde.pdf">Literature Review</a></h2>
				<p>When working on our STEM I projects, we have to conduct a lot of research. Once we get the majority of the important and fundamental research for our individual projects completed, we begin our Literature Reviews. Literature Reviews are essentially relatively large papers which summarize the brunt of the background research for our individual projects. These count to be huge parts of your STW grade, so it is very important to take the time to edit and revise them before submission. If you would like to take a look at my Literature Review, please click the heading above.</p>
